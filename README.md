My Finance Buddy
============

Introduction
-------
My Finance Buddy is a fun and intelligent system that allows one to manage their financials in a creative and engaging way. Unlike most other financial applications or systems currently in the market, My Finance Buddy encourages the users to manage budget and accomplish financial goals by a simple yet motivating gamification of personal accounting.

**Interest Factor:**

All of the group members and classmates are in their third or fourth year of study and will be graduating soon. Throughout their undergraduate or graduate careers they may not have taken their financial matters seriously due to variety of income sources such as scholarships & bursaries and co-op jobs. After graduating we will be required to pay close attention to our budget with limited sources of income and variety of sources of expenditure. Along with managing our budgets and figuring out where to spend our dollar, we also have set goals that we want to accomplish, such as buying a new car or a house, or paying of OSAP in the first 6 months. Worrying about everything at once right after graduating can be quite overwhelming. Hence, as a group we want to use this project as a medium to help not only ourselves but also our classmates by creating a tool that will make the transition into an environment where every financial decision matters stress-free, profitable, and enjoyable.

**Chosen Run-time Environment and Its Benefits:**

For our project we want our system to be accessed from anywhere and at any time when possible. Since this system will also require collaboration with other users that will be using the system (ie. friends of the user), the environment on which the system will operate must also be able to provide us with sufficient technology to do so. Matching our system operation and interaction requirements, a Web-based application suits our needs in every way. By using a web-based application it will allow us to cater to our users through various environments such as desktops and mobile devices that use variety of operating systems and platforms with low cost and minimal effort using the ever advancing web technologies.
